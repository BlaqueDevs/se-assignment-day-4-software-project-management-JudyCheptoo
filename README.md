Product Development: Launching a new product where customer needs and market conditions might evolve. Agile allows teams to adapt to feedback and changes in the market.
Waterfall methodology is good for;
Projects with Well-Defined Requirements: Waterfall works well when the project scope, requirements, and deliverables are clearly defined and unlikely to change. It follows a linear and sequential approach, making it suitable for projects where each phase depends on the completion of the previous one.
Projects Requiring Rigorous Documentation: In industries or projects where comprehensive documentation and adherence to strict processes are essential, Waterfall’s structured approach ensures detailed planning and documentation.
Projects with Regulatory or Compliance Needs: When a project must adhere to strict regulatory requirements or industry standards, Waterfall’s documentation and sequential approach can help ensure compliance.
Examples;
Construction Projects: For example, building a bridge or a residential complex where the requirements are fixed, and the project phases follow a strict sequence of planning, design, construction, and review.
Manufacturing Projects: Developing a new piece of machinery where the design specifications are well-defined and unlikely to change once production begins.
Agile is more beneficial for projects where flexibility, frequent feedback, and iterative development are needed. It excels in dynamic environments with evolving requirements whilst Waterfall is more suited for projects with clear, fixed requirements and a sequential process. It’s ideal for projects where changes are minimal and thorough documentation is necessary. Choosing between Agile and Waterfall depends on the nature of the project, the level of uncertainty, and the need for flexibility versus structure.
